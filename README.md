‚ö° **Extremely Fast:** Nothing beats `fdir` in speed. It can easily crawl a directory containing **10k files in about 13ms.**

üí° **Stupidly Easy:** `fdir` only has 2 functions; `sync` and `async` for crawling the file system synchronously or asynchronously.

ü§ñ **Zero Dependencies:** `fdir` uses pure NodeJS `fs` & `path` namespaces. Nothing else is ever touched.

üï∫ **Astonishingly Small:** Only 2KB in size. Can be used virtually anywhere.

## üöÑ Quickstart

You can install using `npm`:

```sh
$ npm i --save fdir
```

or Yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add fdir
```

It makes no difference to me.

```js
const fdir = require("fdir");

// get all files in a directory synchronously
const files = fdir.sync("path/to/dir");

// or asynchronously
fdir.async("path/to/dir").then(/*blah blah blah*/);
```

And that's it.

## üìä Benchmarks:

> I recently discovered a quirky side in how NodeJS works. It gives different performance when the machine is on direct power and when purely on battery. (If someone knows anything about that, do tell me.) So for the sake of completeness and so that no one disputes my claims, I included benchmarks for both cases.

**Specs:**

- Intel i7 7th Generation
- 16 GB of RAM
- 256 GB SSD
- Directory Size: 14.1 MB / 2400 files

### On Power:

### On Battery:

### Run them Yourself:

```sh
$ yarn benchmark
```

## üöí API:

`fdir` is very small so there's not much to the API.

### `fdir.sync(string, Options): String[]`

This is often the fastest way to get files. However, it will block the main "thread" so use it with caution with large directories.

### `fdir.async(string, Options): Promise<String[]>`

Not always the fastest but works without blocking the street, so that's a plus.

### `Options`

Ah, the options. Not many of them. At least not as many as I'd hoped for.

#### `includeDirs: boolean`

Whether to include directories in the array returned.

`default: false`

#### `includeBasePath: boolean`

Whether to include the base path for each file.

`default: true`

#### `searchFn: Function`

Use this to filter out files.

**Example:**

```js
fdir.sync("node_modules", {
  searchFn: path => path.includes(".git")
});
```

`default: undefined`

#### `maxDepth: number`

The max number of levels `fdir` should crawl before stopping. **The lower the faster.**

`default: undefined (i.e. infinity)`

#### `isExcludedDir: Function`

A list of directories to exclude.

> **Note: `fdir` expects an **Object** not an array.**

**Example:**

```js
const isExcludedDir = path => path.includes(".bin");
fdir.sync("node_modules", { isExcludedDir });
```

`default: undefined`

And that's it.

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è FAQs:

**1. I looked at the code and there's nothing special. How is it so damn fast then?**

Well, that's the whole point. `fdir` exists to prove to the "young" generation that you don't need to use special constructs or special methods to gain speed. Just a bit of patience and brains.

**2. Why create this? What's the point?**

I know you don't give a shit. Fine. There's no point behind this. It's "just for fun". No, wait. Actually, I created this, first of all, for me. I needed fast directory access in another app of mine, so `fdir` came into being.

**3. Why are all the other libraries so slow?**

Because they did not spend enough time optimizing it. Most developers give readability and cool code more importance than actual performance and usability. I have seen a library claiming to be the fastest by inverting the benchmarks. Literally. Gave me quite the scare until I went and fixed the benchmark. It was actually one of the slowest. :O

**4. How long did it take you to create this?**

Ummm. Maybe 18 hours? Make it a day.

**5. Are you looking for a job?**

Am I? Well, are you offering a job? If yes, I am interested. :D

**6. Why should I give a shit?**

You shouldn't. But here's my email in case you do: **thecodrr[at]protonmail.com**. Don't worry, I don't bite.
